Based on Chapter 16 of Eric Matthes' book,
I created a mini-project that automatically reads data from CSV files and generates a temperature graph.
It also extracts the city name from the weather station name recorded in the data.

Possible improvement ideas include:

* using **Plotly** for interactive graphs,
* comparing data between multiple cities,
* generating a **text summary** based on the data,
* saving results to a file,
* and creating separate graphs for other environmental parameters.
